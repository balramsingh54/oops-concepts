	<h3>class :- </h3>It is a blueprint of created objets.<br>
	class myClass:
		x = 5  <br>
	p1 = myClass <br>
	print(p1.x)<br>

	<h3>all classes has function called __init__() that is 	excutedd
	 when class is initiated </h3>

	 class Pesson:  <br>

	 print(p1.age)<br>
	 <h2>Note :-  __init__() is called automatically every time when class is used to create to new  objects</h2><br>

	 <h2>Objects Methods :  </h2>
	 methods of objests are function that belongs to  objects <br>
	 class Pesson:  <br>
	 	def __init__(self, name, age) <br>
	 	self.name = name<br>

    <h3>Note :- self is parameter that is used to access the variables </h3><br>

    <h2>Inherite</h2><h3>It define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.</h3><br>

    <h3>parent Class </h3> a class is being inherited that is called base class<br>

    <h3>child class </h3> inherits from another class also called deriverd class <br>



    <h2>Create  Parent class :- </h2> <br>

    class Person:<br>
    	def __init__(self, firstname,lastname):<br>
    		self.firstname=firstname<br>
    		self.lastname = lastname<br>

    	def myclass(self):<br>
    		Print(self.firstname, self.lastname)<br>


    p1 = Person("Balram", "Singh")<br>

    P1.myclass()<br>



<h2>Create  Parent class :- </h2>Create a child class student that inherit all the properties and methods of Person class <br>

class Student(Person):<br>
	pass<br>

<h2>Note :- </h2> Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or methods to the class. <br>

<h2>ITERator</h2>An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.  <br>


mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") <br>
myit = iter(mytuple) <br>

print(next(myit)) <br>
print(next(myit)) <br>
print(next(myit)) <br>


<h2>What is PIP?</h2>PIP is a package manager for Python packages  <br>
<h3>A package contains all the files you need for a module.</h3><br>
<h3>Modules are Python code libraries you can include in your project.<br>

<h2>Try Except </h2>The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.<br>

The except block lets you handle the error.<br>

The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except <br>



<h2>File handling</h2>The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
<h4>
"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
</h4>
<h3>Syntax </h3>
f = open("demofile.txt")<br>
The code above is the same as:<br>

f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")<br>

demofile.txt<br>

Hello! Welcome to demofile.txt<br>
This file is for testing purposes.<br>
Good Luck!<br>

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")<br>
print(f.read())<br>


Return the 5 first characters of the file:<br>

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")<br>
print(f.read(5))<br>

You can return one line by using the readline() method:<br>
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")<br>
print(f.readline())<br>
################<br>

f = open("demofile.txt", "r")<br>
print(f.readline<br>
f.close()<br>
<h2>delete a file </h2>


import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")
